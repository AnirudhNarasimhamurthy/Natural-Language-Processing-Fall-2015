README
=======

The source code files and all the required files have been put in the folder named "QA_Final". The main python
program is qa.py.There are several other files which I have written and made use of in my program. All of them are
referenced in the way such that all these files are at the same level on a directory.

The QA system made use of Stanford NER for Named Entity Recognition and Stanford POS Tagger, both of which have been added to the
project directory and have been referenced in the program accordingly. I had also made use of WordNet Lemmatizer and nltk library
for tokenization and stemming.

Assuming nltk library is not installed in the local machine and resides on a server machine, use the following pattern to execute 
the code :
<Python path in the system that has nltk library installed> qa.py <inputfile>

Ex: /usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python2 qa.py testset1-inputfile.txt (For test set 1)

If you have nltk library installed, then simply run the program like a normal python script but with a command line input.
Here qa.py is my source python file
inputfile is the command line argument which contains the required input.

The input in this case would contain the path to the input files on the first line and a list of stories in each subsequent line
for which the QA system will read the stories and give out the answers.

THe path has to be changed accordingly when you run it with new set of test cases.

You can also do the following to copy the output to file

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python2 qa.py inputfile > output
