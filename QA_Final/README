Project Dry Run Submission:
===========================

Team Members: Anirudh Narasimhamurthy(u0941400) and Vulpala shiva Priya(u1011589)

1. The source code files and all the required files have been put in the folder named "QA_Final". The main python
program is qa.py.There are several other files which I have written and made use of in my program. All of them are
referenced in the way such that all these files are at the same level on a directory.

I have made use of nltk library and with help from  CADE Opers, we were able to use the installation and set it up.
I am also making use of Stanford NER for Named Entity Recognition and Stanford POS Tagger, both of which have been added to the
project directory and have been referenced in the program accordingly. You don't have to do anything with regards to that.
All you need to do is just unzip my folder and type the below commands on the terminal from my directory

i.e

    Step 1: Unzip our submitted zip source
    Step 2: Open terminal and navigate or do a  cd to our directory
    Step 3: I have the testset1 folder inside the directory. Please copy paste the final set of test files folder into this location
    and follow the convention used in testset1-inputfile while creating the input file for test set2
    Step 3: To compile and run the code, please type the following:

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python2 qa.py testset1-inputfile.txt (For test set 1)

To be more generic it would be

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python2 qa.py <input file> (For test set 2)

Here qa.py is my source python file

inputfile is the command line argument which contains the required input.
Please keep in mind the path for the testset1 right now is pointing to the path in which I have my files in CADE machine,
which is nothing but this folder.
THe path has to be changed accordingly when you run it with new set of test cases.


You can also do the following to copy the output to file

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-2.7.3/bin/python2 qa.py inputfile > output


* Internally my code is now pointing to nltk_data folder of my cade user and I have provided access to users to this
directory. So it should also work when you run it on your system under your CADE user. In case you encounter any issues
kindly let me knwow and I could tell you what is required. My contact email is anirudhnmurthy@gmail.com

I ran my program on CADE machine "lab2-12" and "lab2-7" for testset1 of all 39 files. The running time is anywhere
between 1 hour to 2 hours depending on the time at which our programs are run for evaluation. When I ran it around 11P.M to
3 A.M when there are relatively lesser number of users, it took around 1 hour. When I ran it around 3P.M to 7P.M it took close
to 2 hours.


In case you have any issues with running the code or encounter any errors during the execution let me know. I have tested it
and it seems to be working fine.
