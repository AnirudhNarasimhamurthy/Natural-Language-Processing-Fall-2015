Project Dry Run Submission:
===========================

Team Members: Anirudh Narasimhamurthy(u0941400) and Vulpala shiva Priya(u1011589)

1. The source code files and all the required files have been put in the folder named "Submission". The main python
program is qa.py.There are several other files which I have written and made use of in my program. All of them are
referenced in the way such that all these files are at the same level on a directory.

I have made use of nltk library and with help from  CADE Opers, we were able to use the installation and set it up.


2. To compile and run the code, please type the following:

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-3.5.0/bin/python3 qa.py inputfile

Here qa.py is my source python file
inputfile is the command line argument which contains the required input.
Please keep in mind the path for the developset right now is pointing to the path in which I have my files in CADE machine.
THe path has to be changed accordingly when you run it with new set of test cases.

You can also do the following to copy the output to file

/usr/local/stow/python/amd64_linux26/python-3.5.0/bin/python3 qa.py inputfile > output


* Internally my code is now pointing to nltk_data folder of one of my class mates who has the folder on shared access. I also
have my nltk_data folder with required permissions which would allow you to run. In case you encounter any issues
kindly let me knwow and I could tell you what is required. My contact email is anirudhnmurthy@gmail.com

I ran my program on CADE machine "lab2-12" for developset of all 73 files. During one of those runs it took around 15mins
to execute, but when I was doing the second run it was taking more than 30 mins and is still running as I type in this report
right now.

In my local machine, the set of 73 files ran in roughly about 10-12 minutes.


In case you have any issues with running the code or encounter any errors during the execution let me know. I have tested it
although not exhaustively and it seems to be working fine.
